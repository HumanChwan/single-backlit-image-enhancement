# Implementation of the Paper ["A Single Backlit Image Enhancement Method For Improvement Of Visibility Of Dark Part"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9506526) by M. Akai _et al._

_Refer to the following [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9506526) for mathematical modeling, experimentation and comparisons with other models._

## Quick Start
- Install the requirements using the following command:
    ```console
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Follow the notebook to get results. Modify the `parameters` dictionary to load up other images.
    ```python
    parameters = {
        "FIGURE": "<Image file, eg: fig1.png>",
        "GAMMA": 2,
        "ALPHA": 0.7,
        "EPSILON": 1e-7
    }
    ```

## Results
- Processed and original image. `(fig1.png)`

    ![fig1.png](./Images/fig1.png)
- Processed and original image. `(fig2.jpg)`

Abstract: This study proposes a simple and fast backlit image enhancement method that improves the visibility of dark parts. The proposed method uses gamma correction and histogram equalization to make an intensity-adjusted image and a contrast-enhanced image, respectively. Then, an alpha-blended image of the two images is obtained. Finally, an output image is obtained by fusing the original image and the blended image using alpha blending to avoid causing artifacts in bright parts. The weight for fusion is calculated by using Otsuâ€™s method and the guided filter. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparative experiments.
